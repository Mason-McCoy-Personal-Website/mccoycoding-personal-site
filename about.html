                    Mason has been working since he turned 16, working at Little Caesars before leaving to go work at Savor Flavor Asia.
                    Starting as a server, Mason often worked upwards of 36-40 hour weeks at Savor Flavor Asia, eventually filling multiple roles,
                    including cashier, delivery driver, and Front of House Manager. After he work as a manager, he worked at a car dealership called
                    Earnhardt Ford where he worked with 4-5 other coworkers to maintain and move customer vehicles within a lot for service and maintenance.
                    Afterwards, Mason accepted a position at Amazon Logistics as an Operations Lead, assisting around 161 Amazon Delivery Stations under a developmental department.

                    While working in the Operations Lead position, Mason decided to begin coding as a way to alleviate some of the pressures that the job offered, and has even helped
                    the department to make Standard Work changes. Tools he has helped develop eased the work of fellow Operations Leads allowed for more efficiency within the workplace

                <p class="about-mason">
                    Mason was born in Tucson, Arizona, and has lived in Arizona for his whole life. He and his family were fortunate enough
                    to be able to afford technology and trips, which culminated in a fascination for technology and adventure in him at a young age.
                    In high school, Mason was able to attend a class for Mobile Application Development and began to fall in love with software development.
                    When he graduated from High School in 2019, he and his mother went on a trip to Iceland, where Mason was exposed to Norse culture and mythology,
                    as well as the beautiful sights and extraordinary experiences therein. When he returned, he researched more about the culture and found that a surviving
                    sect of Norse Mythology lived on undet the name 'Asatru' which is modern Icelandic for 'Ã†sir Faith'.
